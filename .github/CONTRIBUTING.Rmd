This document guides contributors. It extends
[README](https://github.com/2DegreesInvesting/pactaCore/blob/main/README.md)
focusing on how this R package differs form a standard one.

* Some environment variables are convenient or required. A good place to set
them is in a project-specific .Renviron file, e.g.:

```{r}
writeLines(readLines(here::here(".Renviron")))
```

* Snapshots are ignored to avoid leaking private data. Re-include public
snapshots in .gitignore, e.g.:

```{r}
lines <- readLines(here::here(".gitignore"))
writeLines(grep("^!tests", lines, value = TRUE))
```
